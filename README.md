# openCV-heatmap
This repository contains the code to generate a heatmap over the live video feed using openCV .


A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors.
"Heat map" is a newer term but shading matrices have existed for over a century

Here I have used the background eliminator and masking technique of opencv.
